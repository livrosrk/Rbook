# Data Types

## 1D

### Homogenoues

#### Vectors

- R has no scalars, only vectors. A scalar is a vector of length 1

### Heterogenous

#### Lists

- Lists are different from atomic vectors as they their elements can be of any type, even other lists

- While vectors are created with `c()`, lists can be created with `list()`

- `c()` will combine multiple lists into one

```{r}

l1 = list(a = 1, b=c(1,2,3))
l2 = list(c=3, d=c(4,5,6))
lCombined = c(l1,l2)
```


## 2D

### Homogenoues

#### Matrices

###### Create a matrix

- The matrix is filled first down the columns
- To create a matrix you can give it the numbers and then provide the dimensions

```{r, echo=F}
z = matrix(seq(1,12),4,3)
z

# first to (and including) second row and second to third column
z[1:2,2:3]

# subsetting one column returns a vector
z[,2]

# dont drop matrix
z[,2,drop=F]
```

### Heterogenous

#### Data frames

- Data frames are lists
