# Attributes

- Any type of object (be it atomic vectors or lists) can have attributes to store metadata

- They are like a named list

- Attributes can be accessed individually with `attr()` or all at once with `attributes()`. 

- Most attributes are lost on modification. Only the `names`-attribute, the `dimensions` and the `class` (important for S3 classes) attribute are kept

- Each of these attributes has a specific accessor function, rather than `attr(x, "names")` you write `names(x)` or `class(x)` 
## Set and get a single attribute

```{r}
y <- 1:10
attr(y, "my_attribute") <- "This is a vector" # set the attribute
attr(y, "my_second_attribute") <- "This is still a vector" 
attr(y, "my_attribute")
```

## Get all attributes

```{r}
attributes(y)
```


## Use structure to create an object with attributes directly

```{r}
ll = structure(list(a=1,b=2), fistAttribute = "first", secondAttribute="second")
```
